## Notes

Notebook ran on Google Colab due to incompatibility between the `WordCloud` library and the latest version of Python on local machine. 
Thus `requirements.txt` is missing but is minimal and noted at the start of the [notebook](https://github.com/forbow-lab/telehealth-wordcloud/blob/main/telehealth-wordcloud.ipynb).
